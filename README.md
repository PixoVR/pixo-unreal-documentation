# pixo-unreal-documentation

This is an Unreal Engine plugin which will scan a project in search of Blueprints and Materials and publish them as parseable (fake) C++ code that can be fed into doxygen to produce documentation.

This works with Unreal **4.27** and **5.x**.

Graphs are published using graphviz dot syntax, which creates an SVG representation of Unreal graph structures.
